# C++ Knowledge
This repo will contain all C++ lessons, concepts, design patterns, software architecture and algorithms which I learned from all kinds of resources (videos, books, people, ...).
First I will group them by teachers. Later I will group them by concepts.

The overall goal of this repo is to have concept with code available to reuse them in projects one might encounter multiple times. This will be kind of my private stackoverflow.
